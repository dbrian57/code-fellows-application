# code-fellows-application

The `code-fellows-application` repo contains the source code and assets for the web app deployed at [deadsimplesynth.com](https://deadsimplesynth.com). dead simple synth is a project that I produced to meet the admission requirements for the Code Fellows intermediate-level bootcamp.

The app contains a project requirements page, an "about me" page, and a hand-coded and designed synthesizer that utilizes the [Tone.js web audio framework](https://tonejs.github.io).

The synth allows you to click the keys of the keyboard and play the key's corresponding note just as you would on a piano or any other synthesizer. dead simple synth contains three octaves from the standard piano layout: octaves three, four, and five. Each time you press a key, the note plays and is recorded to the synth's screen. You can then playback the notes in the same sequence you played them.

dead simple synth is continuously deployed using [DigitalOcean's App Platform](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform).
